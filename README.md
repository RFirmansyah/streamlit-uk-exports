# UK exports after Brexit visualization with Streamlit

Hi, I will try to explain the process of building a visualization using Python and **Streamlit**.  The visualization we are trying to build is about UK exports after Brexit.


# Dataset

The original dataset can be found at:
[ONS (UK trade: goods and services publication table 14)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/uktradegoodsandservicespublicationtables)

For the sake of this visualization, I've made a few changes and saved it in google spreadsheet format, you can find it at:
[Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jUxkeyYX2D9Xss-ojTAcKVrkXalrCHEVQeDM0PfNb8E/)

The dataset itself displays the value of UK exports and imports from 1997 to January 2021.
